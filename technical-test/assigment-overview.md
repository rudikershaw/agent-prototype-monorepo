# Objective and success criteria
This take-home exercise is designed to evaluate your ability to quickly design and develop a first working version of an agentic product.

Please note the following expectations:

* The solution does not need to be perfect or fully optimized.
* The priority is to deliver a functional solution that we can run seamlessly on our
local machines.
* Meeting every single requirement is less important than providing a runnable,
consistent implementation.
* We expect you to spend no more than 4 hours on this exercise.
* You are allowed to use coding assistants.
* If successful, you will be invited to present your solution to a panel, where we will discuss your design decisions and trade-offs.

The goal is to assess your pragmatism, technical judgment, and ability to deliver under
time constraints.

## Expected behavior
You are expected to build the first proof of concept of an agentic product allowing non-technical stakeholders to interact in natural language. The solution should be able to leverage and orchestrate two existing functionalities that are able to perform basic analyses
on a dataset (see section Available data and functions below). The solution is expected to provide relevant answers to the following queries:

* How can you help me?
* What are the main genes involved in lung cancer?
* What is the median value expression of genes involved in breast cancer?
* What is the median value expression of genes involved in esophageal cancer?

## Technical requirements
* The prototype is provided as a github repository and can be run without you on
another laptop
* README markdown file with instructions on how to run and an overview of the
design
* A web application running in Docker is preferred but a command line application running in a terminal is also acceptable
* Language: Python
* Runtime environment - the prototype must execute on a standard Mac (Apple Silicon
or Intel) and Windows 11 laptop with <= 16 GB RAM.
* Don’t depend on a specific GPU
    - The README or a similar file describes the architecture, use and tradeoffs of AI components in the prototype.
    - The README or a similar file describes the pros and cons of using AI-assisted coding in this case 
    
## Available data and functions
*  A csv is attached with this document (owkin_take_home_data.csv)
*  You can rely on the following script gathering two functions.

```python
import pandas as pd
import random
from typing import List, Dict

# Load CSV
df = pd.read_csv("owkin_take_home_data.csv")

def get_targets(cancer_name: str) -> List[str]:
    """Return a list of genes for a given cancer type."""
    return df[df['cancer_indication'] == cancer_name]['gene'].tolist()

def get_expressions(genes: List[str]) -> Dict[str, float]:
    """Return the median values for the given list of genes."""
    subset = df[df['gene'].isin(genes)]
    return dict(zip(subset['gene'], subset['median_value']))

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    cancer = "lung"
    targets = get_targets(cancer)
    expressions = get_expressions(targets)
    print(f"{cancer} targets:", targets)
    print(f"Expression values:", expressions)
```
